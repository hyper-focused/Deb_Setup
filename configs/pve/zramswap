# /etc/default/zramswap — Proxmox VE (bare metal)
# Deployed by hyper-focused/Deb_Setup init.sh
#
# ZFS volumes do not support swap partitions; zram provides compressed
# in-memory swap. KSM (Kernel Same-page Merging) is managed by PVE directly.
#
# Compression: lz4 (low latency) or zstd (higher ratio, more CPU)
ALGO=lz4

# PERCENT: zram device size as a percentage of total physical RAM.
# The device is sparse — compressed usage is typically 30-50% of this value.
#   16 GB RAM @ 25% → 4 GB device  → ~1-2 GB actual memory used
#   64 GB RAM @ 25% → 16 GB device → ~5-8 GB actual memory used
PERCENT=25
